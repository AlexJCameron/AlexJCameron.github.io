<p>
I am an Australian astronomer interested in using deep observations to understand the chemical evolution of galaxies. I am a member of [JADES](https://jades-survey.github.io/), a join NIRCam + NIRSpec GTO program which is using the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) to perform a large survey number of galaxies at high-redshift, providing unprecedented new insights into galaxy evolution in the early Universe. Additionally, I'm also interested in using integral-field spectroscopy from ground-based observatories to study inflows and outflows of gas in low-redshift galaxies.

I hail from the small town of Wangaratta in rural south-eastern Australia. I completed my Ph.D. at the University of Melbourne in 2021. Currently, I am a postdoctoral research assistant at the University of Oxford.

In my spare time I enjoy reading, spending time outdoors (hiking, rock climbing, surfing), and playing board games.
