My research interests are primarily in galaxy evolution.
In particular, I use deep spectroscopy of galaxies to understand the properties of their stellar populations and interstellar medium, and how these shape that evolution.
I am heavily involved with with James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) observations of high-redshift galaxies and am a member of the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) JADES GTO program, the largest JWST galaxy evolution program to date.
I also have extensive experience using integral-field spectroscopy from ground-based observatories to study low-redshift galaxies in great detail.

I hail from the small town of Wangaratta in rural south-eastern Australia. I completed my Ph.D. at the University of Melbourne in 2021. Currently, I am a postdoctoral research assistant at the University of Oxford.

In my spare time I enjoy reading, spending time outdoors (hiking, rock climbing, surfing), and playing board games.
