        <p>The abundance of heavy elements (metallicity) in the 
interstellar medium (ISM) of galaxies is enriched by stellar 
nucleosynthesis, but is also mediated by galaxy scale gas flows, in 
particular metal-poor inflows and metal-enriched outflows. The imprint 
that these processes leave on chemical abundances in galaxies enable us 
to use abundance measurements as a powerful diagnostic for probing the 
assembly history of galaxies. My main research interests involve using 
ground- and space-based facilities measure abundances in galaxies in 
order to better understand how this complex array of evolutionary 
processes shapes galaxies.</p>

<h2 id="chemical-evolution-in-the-early-universe-with-jwst">Chemical evolution in the early Universe with JWST</h2>

<p>Following its recent successful launch, the James Webb Space 
Telescope (JWST) is set to revolutionise astronomy.
In particular, NIRSpec, the primary spectrograph aboard JWST, will 
enable us to measure abundances in galaxies at much earlier cosmic 
epochs than was previously possible.
As a member of the NIRSpec GTO team, I will be among the first to get 
the chance to use these exciting data.
I will be working with data collected as part of the <em>JWST Advanced Deep Extragalactic Survey</em> (<em>JADES</em>),
 a joint NIRCam and NIRSpec GTO program. This large survey will collect 
spectroscopy and imaging for a large number of galaxies at <em>z ‚â≥ 2 - 9</em>
 and beyond. This unprecedented dataset will vastly improve our 
understanding of the properties of galaxies at the highest redshifts.</p>

<h2 id="direct-observations-of-the-metallicity-in-galactic-outflows-at-low-redshift">Direct observations of the metallicity in galactic outflows at low-redshift</h2>

<p>The cycle of gas into galaxies via accretion, and back out via 
outflows, is one of the most important regulators of galaxy evolution. 
It‚Äôs widely expected that accretion of metal-poor gas and outflows of 
metal-enriched gas are critical processes in shaping galaxy evolution. 
However, direct observations of abundances in inflows and outflows have 
historically been lacking, due to the difficulties in observing this 
diffuse gas.</p>

<p>Recently, along with collaborators at Swinburne University of 
Technology, I obtained deep Keck/KCWI IFU observations in which we were 
able to directly constrain the oxygen abundance in inflows, outflows, 
and the ISM in the edge-on galaxy Mrk 1486. These observations, taken as
 part of the <em>Deep near-UV observations of Entrained gas in Turbulent galaxies</em> survey (<a href="https://www.deannefisher.com/duvet"><em>DUVET</em> survey</a>),
 are the first example of the abundances in these three phases being 
simultaneously determined using a single self-consistent method. In 
particular, we were able to use KCWI to map the extremely faint 
‚Äúauroral‚Äù emission line [O <sub><sup>III</sup></sub>]ùùÄ4363 in the 
inflowing and outflowing gas. This enabled us to make robust 
temperature-based measurements which have afforded powerful new 
constraints on the baryon cycle of galaxies.</p>
