## Galaxies pump out contaminated exhausts

In August 2021, the release of my paper reporting the first direct-method measurement of chemically enriched outflows in an edge-on galaxy was accompanied by a press release entitled [*Galaxies pump out contaminated exhausts*](https://www.scienceinpublic.com.au/media-releases/duvet). This release was picked up by a number of outlets, resulting in many news articles being published.

 * [***Look: How the explosive death of stars pollutes the galaxy*** (Inverse)](https://nc.inverse.com/science/galaxies-release-gas-that-pollutes-their-environment)

## Doppler Redshift with Slinkies

As part of the ASTRO 3D "Astro in the Home" YouTube series, I use slinkies to demonstrate how astronomers can use the colours of light to understand the motions of stars and galaxies in the cosmos.
