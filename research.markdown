The abundance of heavy elements (metallicity) in the interstellar medium (ISM) of galaxies is enriched by stellar nucleosynthesis, but is also mediated by galaxy scale gas flows, in particular metal-poor inflows and metal-enriched outflows. The imprints that these processes leave on chemical abundances in galaxies enable us to use abundance measurements as a powerful diagnostic for probing the assembly history of galaxies. My main research interests involve using ground- and space-based facilities measure abundances in galaxies in order to better understand how this complex array of evolutionary processes shapes galaxies.

## Chemical evolution in the early Universe with JWST

Following its recent successful launch, the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) is set to revolutionise astronomy.
In particular, NIRSpec, the primary spectrograph aboard JWST, will enable us to measure abundances in galaxies at much earlier cosmic epochs than was previously possible.
As a member of the NIRSpec GTO team, I will be among the first to get the chance to use these exciting data.
I will be working with data collected as part of the *JWST Advanced Deep Extragalactic Survey* (*JADES*), a joint NIRCam and NIRSpec GTO program. This large survey will collect spectroscopy and imaging for a large number of galaxies at *z ‚â≥ 2 - 9* and beyond. This unprecedented dataset will vastly improve our understanding of the properties of galaxies at the highest redshifts.


## Direct observations of the metallicity in galactic outflows at low-redshift

The cycle of gas into galaxies via accretion, and back out via outflows, known as the baryon cycle, is one of the most important regulators of galaxy evolution. It's widely expected that accretion of metal-poor gas and outflows of metal-enriched gas are critical processes in shaping galaxy evolution. However, direct observations of abundances in inflows and outflows have historically been lacking, due to the difficulties in observing this diffuse gas.

Recently, along with collaborators at Swinburne University of Technology, I obtained deep Keck/KCWI IFU observations in which we were able to [directly constrain the oxygen abundance in inflows, outflows, and the ISM, in the edge-on galaxy Mrk 1486](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021ApJ...918L..16C/abstract). These observations, taken as part of the *Deep near-UV observations of Entrained gas in Turbulent galaxies* survey ([*DUVET* survey](https://www.deannefisher.com/duvet)), are the first example of the abundances in these three phases being simultaneously determined using a single self-consistent method. In particular, we were able to use KCWI to map the extremely faint "auroral" emission line [OIII]ùùÄ4363 in the inflowing and outflowing gas. This enabled us to make robust temperature-based measurements which have yielded powerful new constraints on the baryon cycle of galaxies.
